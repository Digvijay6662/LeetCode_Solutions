Hint
Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.
Example 3:

Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:

        def findSum(a, n):
            temp_sum = n / 2 * (2 * a + n - 1)
            return temp_sum
        
        total = 0
        week = 0

        while n:
            if n >= 7:
                days = 7
            else:
                days = n

            total += findSum(1 + week, days)
            n -= days
            week += 1

        return int(total)


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        week = 0

        while n > 0:
            for day in range(1, 8):
                if n > 0:
                    total += week + day
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    break

            week += 1

        return total


Solution 3:

class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:
        m = n // 7  # (no.of full weeks)
        result = 0

        # calculating full weeks
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            result += 7 * (i + 3)

        # calculating left days
        for i in range(7 * m, n):
            m += 1
            result += m

        return result
