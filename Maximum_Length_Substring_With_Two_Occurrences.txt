Companies
Hint
Given a string s, return the maximum length of a 
substring
 such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bcbbbcba"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def maximumLengthSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        count = defaultdict(int)
        max_length = l = 0

        for r in range(n):
            count[s[r]] += 1

            while count[s[r]] > 2:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                if count[s[l]] == 0:
                    del count[s[l]]
                l += 1
            
            max_length = max(max_length, r - l + 1)

        return max_length
