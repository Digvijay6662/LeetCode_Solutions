Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split()
        l, r = 0, len(words) - 1

        while l < r:
            words[l], words[r] = words[r], words[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1

        return " ".join(words)


Solution 2:


class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = ""
        r = len(s) - 1

        while r >= 0:
            temp = r
            while r >= 0 and s[r] != " ":
                r -= 1

            if res:
                res = res + " " + s[r+1:temp+1]
            else:
                res = s[r+1:temp+1]

            while r >= 0 and s[r] == " ":
                r -= 1

        return res


Solution 3:

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = []
        r = len(s) - 1

        while r >= 0:
            while r >= 0 and s[r] == " ":
                r -= 1

            temp = r
            while r >= 0 and s[r] != " ":
                r -= 1

            word = s[r+1:temp+1]
            if word:
                words.append(word)

        return " ".join(words)
