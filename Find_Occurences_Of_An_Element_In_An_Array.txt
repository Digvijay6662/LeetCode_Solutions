Hint
You are given an integer array nums, an integer array queries, and an integer x.

For each queries[i], you need to find the index of the queries[i]th occurrence of x in the nums array. If there are fewer than queries[i] occurrences of x, the answer should be -1 for that query.

Return an integer array answer containing the answers to all queries.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,7], queries = [1,3,2,4], x = 1

Output: [0,-1,2,-1]

Explanation:

For the 1st query, the first occurrence of 1 is at index 0.
For the 2nd query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in nums, so the answer is -1.
For the 3rd query, the second occurrence of 1 is at index 2.
For the 4th query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in nums, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], queries = [10], x = 5

Output: [-1]

Explanation:

For the 1st query, 5 doesn't exist in nums, so the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 105
1 <= queries[i] <= 105
1 <= nums[i], x <= 104


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def occurrencesOfElement(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[int], x: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(n):
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i]
            if nums[i] == x:
                prefix[i + 1] += 1
        
        result = []
        for q in queries:
            idx = bisect.bisect_left(prefix, q)
            if idx == n + 1:
                result.append(-1)
            else:
                result.append(idx - 1)
        
        return result


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def occurrencesOfElement(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[int], x: int) -> List[int]:
        occurrences = {}
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num not in occurrences:
                occurrences[num] = []
            occurrences[num].append(i)
        
        result = []
        for q in queries:
            if x in occurrences and q <= len(occurrences[x]):
                result.append(occurrences[x][q - 1])
            else:
                result.append(-1)
        
        return result


Solution 3:

class Solution:
    def occurrencesOfElement(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[int], x: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        occurrences = []

        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == x:
                occurrences.append(i)

        m = len(occurrences)
        result = []
        
        for q in queries:
            if q <= m:
                result.append(occurrences[q - 1])
            else:
                result.append(-1)

        return result
