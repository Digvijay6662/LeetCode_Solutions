Medium
Companies
Hint
You are given a string s and a character c. Return the total number of 
substrings
 of s that start and end with c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abada", c = "a"

Output: 6

Explanation: Substrings starting and ending with "a" are: "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada".

Example 2:

Input: s = "zzz", c = "z"

Output: 6

Explanation: There are a total of 6 substrings in s and all start and end with "z".

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s and c consist only of lowercase English letters.


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str, c: str) -> int:
        count = {}
        result = 0

        for ch in s:
            if ch == c:
                count[ch] = count.get(ch, 0) + 1
                result += count[ch]
        
        return result


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str, c: str) -> int:
        count = result = 0

        for ch in s:
            if ch == c:
                count += 1
        
        return count * (count + 1)//2
