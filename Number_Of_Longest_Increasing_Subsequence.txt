Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2000
-106 <= nums[i] <= 106


Solution:

class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        lengths = [1] * n
        counts = [1] * n
        maxLIS = 1
        res = 0

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if nums[j] > nums[i]:
                    if lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]:
                        lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1
                        counts[i] = counts[j]
                    elif lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]:
                        counts[i] += counts[j]

            if lengths[i] > maxLIS:
                maxLIS = lengths[i]
                res = counts[i]
            elif lengths[i] == maxLIS:
                res += counts[i]

        return res
