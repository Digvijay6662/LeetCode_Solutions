Hint
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        counts = {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0}
        result = j = 0

        for i in range(n):
            counts[s[i]] += 1

            while all(counts.values()):
                result += n - i  # Count all substrings ending at index i containing 'a', 'b', and 'c'
                counts[s[j]] -= 1
                j += 1

        return result
