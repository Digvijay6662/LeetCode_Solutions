Companies
Hint
You are given an integer array nums.
A 
subsequence
 sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies:

(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2.
Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,1,2,1,2]

Output: 6

Explanation:

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 3].

 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 107


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        total_even = prev_even = prev_odd = 0

        for num in nums:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                total_even += 1
                prev_even = prev_odd + 1
            else:
                prev_odd = prev_even + 1
        
        total_odd = n - total_even
        return max(total_even, total_odd, prev_even, prev_odd)
