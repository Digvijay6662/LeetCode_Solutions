Hint
You are given a m x n 2D array board representing a chessboard, where board[i][j] represents the value of the cell (i, j).

Rooks in the same row or column attack each other. You need to place three rooks on the chessboard such that the rooks do not attack each other.

Return the maximum sum of the cell values on which the rooks are placed.

 

Example 1:

Input: board = [[-3,1,1,1],[-3,1,-3,1],[-3,2,1,1]]

Output: 4

Explanation:



We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 1) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output: 15

Explanation:

We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2) for a sum of 1 + 5 + 9 = 15.

Example 3:

Input: board = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]

Output: 3

Explanation:

We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

 

Constraints:

3 <= m == board.length <= 500
3 <= n == board[i].length <= 500
-109 <= board[i][j] <= 109


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def maximumValueSum(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n, m = len(board), len(board[0])

        # Initialize the list to store the top 3 elements for each row
        rows = []
        for i in range(n):
            heap = []
            for j in range(m):
                if len(heap) < 3:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (board[i][j], i, j))
                else:
                    heapq.heappushpop(heap, (board[i][j], i, j))
            rows.extend(heap)

        # Initialize the list to store the top 3 elements for each column
        cols = []
        for j in range(m):
            heap = []
            for i in range(n):
                if len(heap) < 3:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (board[i][j], i, j))
                else:
                    heapq.heappushpop(heap, (board[i][j], i, j))
            cols.extend(heap)

        combined = set(rows) & set(cols)
        top_elements = []

        for element in combined:
            if len(top_elements) < 11:
                heapq.heappush(top_elements, (element[0], element[1], element[2]))
            else:
                heapq.heappushpop(top_elements, (element[0], element[1], element[2]))

        result = float("-inf")
        length = len(top_elements)

        # Use three nested loops to iterate through all combinations of three elements
        for i in range(length):
            for j in range(i + 1, length):
                for k in range(j + 1, length):
                    x, y, z = top_elements[i], top_elements[j], top_elements[k]
                    # Check if the elements are in different rows and columns
                    if len({x[1], y[1], z[1]}) == 3 and len({x[2], y[2], z[2]}) == 3:
                        # Calculate the sum of the values
                        current_sum = x[0] + y[0] + z[0]
                        # Update the result if the current sum is larger
                        result = max(result, current_sum)

        # Return the maximum sum
        return result
