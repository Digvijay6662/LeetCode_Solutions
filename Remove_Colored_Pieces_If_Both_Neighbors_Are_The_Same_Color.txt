On Alice's second turn, she has no more pieces that she can remove.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.
 

Constraints:

1 <= colors.length <= 105
colors consists of only the letters 'A' and 'B'


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        n = len(colors)
        a_moves = 0
        b_moves = 0

        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if colors[i - 1] == colors[i] == colors[i + 1]:
                if colors[i] == 'A':
                    a_moves += 1
                else:
                    b_moves += 1

        return a_moves > b_moves
