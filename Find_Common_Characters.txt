Given a string array words, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the words (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:

Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        n = len(words)
        count = Counter(words[0])

        for i in range(1, n):
            temp = Counter(words[i])
            for ch in count:
                count[ch] = min(count[ch], temp[ch])

        result = []
        for ch, freq in count.items():
            for i in range(freq):
                result.append(ch)

        return result


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        if not words:
            return []

        count = Counter(words[0])
        for word in words[1:]:
            count &= Counter(word)

        result = list(count.elements())

        return result
