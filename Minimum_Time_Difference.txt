Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.
 

Example 1:

Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104
timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(timePoints)
        minutes = []

        for i in range(n):
            val = int(timePoints[i][:2]) * 60 + int(timePoints[i][3:])
            minutes.append(val)

        minutes.sort()
        result = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n):
            result = min(result, minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1])
        
        result = min(result, minutes[0] + 24 * 60 - minutes[-1])
        
        return result
