Hint
You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.

Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "aaaa", "aaaa", and "aaaa".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcdef"
Output: -1
Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abcaba"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "abcaba", "abcaba", and "abcaba".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
s consists of only lowercase English letters.


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        lengths = [1] * n  # Lengths of special substrings ending at each index

        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                lengths[i] = lengths[i - 1] + 1

        char_groups = defaultdict(list)
        for i, length in enumerate(lengths):
            char_groups[s[i]].append(length)  # Group lengths by character


        max_length = -1
        for lengths in char_groups.values():
            lengths.sort(reverse=True)
            if len(lengths) >= 3:
                max_length = max(max_length, lengths[2])

        return max_length


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        left, right = 0, n - 2

        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            length, last = 0, 0
            countMap = defaultdict(int)

            for c in s:
                length = length + 1 if c == last else 1
                last = c
                if length >= mid:
                    countMap[c] += 1

            valid = False
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if countMap[chr(c)] >= 3:
                    valid = True
                    break
            if valid:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1   
                
        return right


Solution 3:

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        countMap = defaultdict(list)
        i = 0

        while i < n:
            count = 1
            i += 1
            while i < n and s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
            countMap[s[i - 1]].append(count)

        result = -1

        for values in countMap.values():
            v1, v2, v3 = 0, 0, 0

            for val in values:
                if v1 < val:
                    v3, v2, v1 = v2, v1, val
                elif v2 < val:
                    v3, v2 = v2, val
                elif v3 < val:
                    v3 = val

            if v1 == v2 and v1 > v3:
                v2 -= 1
                
            if v1 + v2 + v3 >= 3:
                result = max(result, v1 - 2, v2)

        return result
