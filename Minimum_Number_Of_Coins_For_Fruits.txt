Solved

Hint
You are at a fruit market with different types of exotic fruits on display.

You are given a 1-indexed array prices, where prices[i] denotes the number of coins needed to purchase the ith fruit.

The fruit market has the following offer:

If you purchase the ith fruit at prices[i] coins, you can get the next i fruits for free.
Note that even if you can take fruit j for free, you can still purchase it for prices[j] coins to receive a new offer.

Return the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can acquire the fruits as follows:
- Purchase the 1st fruit with 3 coins, you are allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free.
- Purchase the 2nd fruit with 1 coin, you are allowed to take the 3rd fruit for free.
- Take the 3rd fruit for free.
Note that even though you were allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free, you purchased it because it is more optimal.
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,10,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can acquire the fruits as follows:
- Purchase the 1st fruit with 1 coin, you are allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free.
- Take the 2nd fruit for free.
- Purchase the 3rd fruit for 1 coin, you are allowed to take the 4th fruit for free.
- Take the 4th fruit for free.
It can be proven that 2 is the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 1000
1 <= prices[i] <= 105


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

        def solve(i, rem):
            if i == n:
                return 0

            if dp[i][rem] != -1:
                return dp[i][rem]

            if rem:
                ans = min(prices[i] + solve(i + 1, i + 1), solve(i + 1, rem - 1))
            else:
                ans = prices[i] + solve(i + 1, i + 1)

            dp[i][rem] = ans
            return ans
        
        return solve(0, 0)


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for rem in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if rem:
                    ans = min(prices[i] + dp[i + 1][i + 1], dp[i + 1][rem - 1])
                else:
                    ans = prices[i] + dp[i + 1][i + 1]

                dp[i][rem] = ans

        return dp[0][0]


Solution 3:

class Solution:
    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for rem in range(n - i + 1):
                if rem > 0:
                    dp[i][rem] = min(prices[i] + dp[i + 1][i + 1], dp[i + 1][rem - 1])
                else:
                    dp[i][rem] = prices[i] + dp[i + 1][i + 1]

        return dp[0][0]


Solution 4:

class Solution:
    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        prev = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            curr = [0] * (n + 1)
            for rem in range(n - i + 1):
                if rem > 0:
                    curr[rem] = min(prices[i] + prev[i + 1], prev[rem - 1])
                else:
                    curr[rem] = prices[i] + prev[i + 1]
            prev = curr

        return prev[0]


Solution 5:

class Solution:
    def minimumCoins(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            curr_coins = dp[i - 1] + prices[i - 1]

            for j in range(i + 1):
                dp[min(n, i + j)] = min(dp[min(n, i + j)], curr_coins)

        return dp[n]
