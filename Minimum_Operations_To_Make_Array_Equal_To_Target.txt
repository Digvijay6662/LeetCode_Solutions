Hint
You are given two positive integer arrays nums and target, of the same length.

In a single operation, you can select any 
subarray
 of nums and increment or decrement each element within that subarray by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums equal to the array target.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,1,2], target = [4,6,2,4]

Output: 2

Explanation:

We will perform the following operations to make nums equal to target:
- Increment nums[0..3] by 1, nums = [4,6,2,3].
- Increment nums[3..3] by 1, nums = [4,6,2,4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,2], target = [2,1,4]

Output: 5

Explanation:

We will perform the following operations to make nums equal to target:
- Increment nums[0..0] by 1, nums = [2,3,2].
- Decrement nums[1..1] by 1, nums = [2,2,2].
- Decrement nums[1..1] by 1, nums = [2,1,2].
- Increment nums[2..2] by 1, nums = [2,1,3].
- Increment nums[2..2] by 1, nums = [2,1,4].

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length == target.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 108


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        result = 0
        prev_diff = 0

        for i in range(n):
            curr_diff = nums[i] - target[i]
            
            if (prev_diff < 0 and curr_diff > 0) or (prev_diff > 0 and curr_diff < 0):
                result += abs(curr_diff)
            elif abs(prev_diff) < abs(curr_diff):
                result += abs(curr_diff) - abs(prev_diff)

            prev_diff = curr_diff
        
        return result


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        inc = dec = result = 0

        for i in range(n):
            diff = target[i] - nums[i]

            if diff > 0:
                if inc < diff:
                    result += diff - inc
                inc = diff
                dec = 0
            elif diff < 0:
                if diff < dec:
                    result += dec - diff
                dec = diff
                inc = 0
            else:
                inc = dec = 0

        return result
