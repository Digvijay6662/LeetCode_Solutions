Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?


Solution:


class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        left, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        currIndex = 0

        while left <= end:
            if nums[left] != 0:
                nums[currIndex] = nums[left]
                currIndex += 1

            left += 1
            
        
        while currIndex <= end:
            nums[currIndex] = 0
            currIndex += 1
